It was made to practice and show off my skills with JavaScript
## Description

- My motivation for this project was to work with API and get a better understanding of how to use them and create a working .    
- I built this project, because I wanted to create a webpage that would save city's weather and be able to save them in local storage.
- This project gives me the ability to use the local storage to save information into a weather page and also work with API. 
- I'm starting to really understand that no matter what, you are mostly likely going to be struggling the whole time in this bootcamp, but to keep working on yourself and even though I messed up really badly on my last assignment and felt overwhelmed. I asked for more help this time and worked with my classmates.

I starting to get a better understanding of how javascript works and how I need to set everything up. I still have a lot of work to do, but at least I'm always progressing and learning more.
